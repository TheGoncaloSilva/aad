# AAD

Repository used for Advanced Computer Architecture (Arquitetura Avan√ßada de Computadores) University course. It's objectives are:
 
1. Introduction of fundamental concepts found in the latest processor generations and their impact on computational system performance.
2. Explanation of memory hierarchy organization, with a specific focus on cache and virtual memories.
3. Familiarization of students with computer architecture simulation tools and their utility in performance evaluation.

In essence, the aim is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of advanced processor technologies, memory organization principles, and simulation methodologies used in assessing computational system performance. An introduction to GPU parallelism and CUDA programming language was also approached.

Achived final grade of 16 out of 20.
